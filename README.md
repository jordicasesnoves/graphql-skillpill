# GraphQL introduction - Skill Pill

Hi :) Welcome to the GraphQL introduction Skill Pill.

This is a template repo.

## How to run the project

Install the dependencies:

```bash

You'll also need json-server for creating a mocked REST API:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

Run the project:

```bash
# Run the Apollo Server
npm run dev

# Run the json-server
json-server --watch db.json
```

You can access to the Apollo Server at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)
